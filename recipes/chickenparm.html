        <h4>------------------Recipe--------------------</h4>
        <h4>---------------Ingredients-----------------</h4>
        <p> 4 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves <br>
            salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste <br>
            2 large eggs <br>
            1 cup panko bread crumbs, or more as needed <br>
            ¾ cup grated Parmesan cheese, divided <br>
            2 tablespoons all-purpose flour, or more if needed <br>
            ½ cup olive oil for frying, or as needed <br>
            ½ cup prepared tomato sauce <br>
            ¼ cup fresh mozzarella, cut into small cubes <br>
            ¼ cup chopped fresh basil <br>
            ½ cup grated provolone cheese <br>
            2 teaspoons olive oil <br>
        </p>
        <h4>--------------Instructions-----------------</h4>
            <p> Step 1: Preheat an oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). <br>
                Step 2: Place chicken breasts between two sheets of heavy plastic (resealable freezer bags work well) on a solid, level surface. Firmly pound chicken with the smooth side of a meat mallet to a thickness of 1/2-inch. <br>
                Step 3: Season chicken thoroughly with salt and pepper. Using a sifter or strainer; sprinkle flour over chicken breasts, evenly coating both sides. <br>
                Step 4: Beat eggs in a shallow bowl and set aside. <br>
                Step 5: Mix bread crumbs and 1/2 cup Parmesan cheese in a separate bowl, set aside. <br>
                Step 6: Dip a flour-coated chicken breast in beaten eggs. Transfer breast to the bread crumb mixture, pressing crumbs into both sides. Repeat for each breast. Let chicken rest for 10 to 15 minutes. <br>
                Step 7: Heat 1/2 inch olive oil in a large skillet on medium-high heat until it begins to shimmer. Cook chicken in the hot oil until golden, about 2 minutes per side. The chicken will finish cooking in the oven. <br>
                Step 8: Transfer chicken to a baking dish. Top each breast with 2 tablespoons tomato sauce. Layer each chicken breast with equal amounts of mozzarella cheese, fresh basil, and provolone cheese. Sprinkle remaining Parmesan over top and drizzle each with 1/2 teaspoon olive oil. <br>
                Step 9: Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is browned and bubbly and chicken breasts are no longer pink in the center, 15 to 20 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). <br>
                Step 10: Eat up!
